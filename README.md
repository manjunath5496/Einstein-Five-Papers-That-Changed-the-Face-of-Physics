<p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong>&nbsp;(14 March 1879&nbsp;&ndash; 18 April 1955) was a German-born&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics">theoretical physicist</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-Bio_6-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is known for developing the&nbsp;<a title="World War II" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">theory of relativity</a>, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of&nbsp;<a title="Quantum mechanics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of&nbsp;<a title="Modern physics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics">modern physics</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-frs_4-2" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-YangHamilton2010_7-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;His&nbsp;<a title="Mass&ndash;energy equivalence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence">mass&ndash;energy equivalence</a>&nbsp;formula&nbsp;<span class="texhtml"><a title="Mass&ndash;energy equivalence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence#Mass%E2%80%93velocity_relationship"><em>E</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>mc</em><sup>2</sup></a></span>, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".<sup id="cite_ref-LnLVo_8-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;His work is also known for its influence on the&nbsp;<a title="Philosophy of science" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science">philosophy of science</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-xZQWt_9-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3UiiT_10-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;He received the 1921&nbsp;<a title="Nobel Prize in Physics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>&nbsp;"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the&nbsp;<a title="German Empire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">photoelectric effect</a>",<sup id="cite_ref-Nobel_Prize_11-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming&nbsp;<a title="Archetypal name" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetypal_name">synonymous</a>&nbsp;with "genius".<sup id="cite_ref-wordnetweb.princeton.edu_12-0" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>In 1905, a year sometimes described as his&nbsp;<em><a title="Annus mirabilis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_mirabilis">annus mirabilis</a></em>&nbsp;('miracle year'), Einstein published&nbsp;<a title="Annus Mirabilis papers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers">four groundbreaking papers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGalison2000377_13-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained&nbsp;<a title="Brownian motion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">Brownian motion</a>, introduced&nbsp;<a title="Special relativity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">special relativity</a>, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of&nbsp;<a title="Classical mechanics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics">classical mechanics</a>&nbsp;could no longer be reconciled with those of the&nbsp;<a title="Electromagnetic field" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field">electromagnetic field</a>, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on&nbsp;<a title="General relativity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general relativity</a>&nbsp;in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.<sup id="cite_ref-Nobel_14-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-NYT-20151124_15-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;He continued to deal with problems of&nbsp;<a title="Statistical mechanics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>&nbsp;and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the&nbsp;<a title="Brownian motion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">motion of molecules</a>. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the&nbsp;<a title="Photon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photon</a>&nbsp;theory of light. However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature "does not play dice".<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;Second, he attempted to devise a&nbsp;<a title="Unified field theory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory">unified field theory</a>&nbsp;by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.</p>
<p>Einstein was born in the&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire">German Empire</a>, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the&nbsp;<a title="Kingdom of W&uuml;rttemberg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of W&uuml;rttemberg</a>)<sup id="cite_ref-GEcitizen_1-2" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss&nbsp;<a title="ETH Zurich" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich">Federal polytechnic school</a>&nbsp;(later renamed as ETH Zurich) in&nbsp;<a title="Z&uuml;rich" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich">Z&uuml;rich</a>, graduating in 1900. In 1901 he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the&nbsp;<a title="Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Institute_of_Intellectual_Property">Swiss Patent Office</a>&nbsp;in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the&nbsp;<a title="University of Zurich" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Zurich">University of Zurich</a>. In 1914, Einstein moved to&nbsp;<a title="Berlin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a>&nbsp;in order to join the&nbsp;<a title="Prussian Academy of Sciences" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences">Prussian Academy of Sciences</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a title="Humboldt University of Berlin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>. In 1917, Einstein became director of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Institute_for_Physics">Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics</a>; he also became a German citizen again &ndash; Prussian this time. In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States,&nbsp;<a title="Adolf Hitler" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>&nbsp;came to power. Einstein did not return to Germany because he objected to the policies of the newly elected&nbsp;<a title="Nazi Germany" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany">Nazi-led government</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-zE9Bz_17-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;He settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.<sup id="cite_ref-BoyerDubofsky2001_18-0" class="reference"></sup>&nbsp;On the eve of&nbsp;<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>, he endorsed&nbsp;<a title="Einstein&ndash;Szil&aacute;rd letter" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter">a letter</a>&nbsp;to President&nbsp;<a title="Franklin D.
